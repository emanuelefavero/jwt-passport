# JWT Passport

This is a simple example of how to use [passport-jwt](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-jwt/) to authenticate users.

## Installation

- Clone the repository, then:

```bash
cd jwt-passport
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

OR (if you have nodemon installed)

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Test API

- If you have vscode installed, you can use the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension to test the API. (SEE test.http file)
- you can also use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the API. (use the test.http file as a reference for the requests)
